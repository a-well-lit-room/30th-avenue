            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>This website presents a video/hypertext document of 30th Avenue in Queens, New York, United States. Videos are broadcast at the original time of their recording. For example, a video recorded at 8:05 pm will be broadcast at 8:05 pm. In an effort to minimize resource consumption while using the archive, each video file has been compressed to be smaller than 2 MB.</p>
            
            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>This project is derived from many inspirations, and I owe thanks and praise to the following people, works, and processes: the <a href="https://github.com/antiboredom/infinite-video-fall-2023">Infinite Video</a> course at the <a href="https://sfpc.study/">School for Poetic Computation</a>, including the instructors Sam Lavigne and Jonathan Gray, and all of my amazing classmates, for their guidance, education, and constructive critiques; conversations and support from Mallory, Monica H.H., and Saint; inspiration from afar by the writings of Kristoffer at <a href="https://www.naiveweekly.com/">Naive Weekly</a> and <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/">Laurel Schwulst</a>; and projects like <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low Tech Magazine</a> and <a href="http://solarprotocol.net/">Solar Protocol</a>, which greatly influenced my approach to publishing this project. Unfortunately, this website is not (yet) powered by the sun.</p>

            <h2>Participation</h2>
            <p>Videos submitted by Kaelan Burkett. If you have videos you would like to submit to the project, please email me at kaelan@kaelanburkett.com. Include the video files you would like to submit, and how you would like to be attributed on this page.</p>

            <h2>How to compress the videos</h2>
            <p>If you are interested in submitting videos to this project, or just want to compress videos for other uses, you can make use of the <a href="https://github.com/a-well-lit-room/30th-avenue/blob/main/scripts/video_conversion.py">python script I'm using for this archive</a>. This script uses ffmpeg and ffprobe  to convert videos into tiny webm files, while preserving metadata about their creation time and gps location (if available). This metadata is essential for making the files accessible in this publication.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about using this script, or have suggestions for changing the script, send me an email or submit a request on <a href="https://github.com/a-well-lit-room/30th-avenue">github</a>. The script is actively in development, as I still need to adapt it to the various metadata formats used by different cell phone manufacturers.</p>
