# 30th Avenue

This website presents a video/hypertext document of 30th Avenue in Queens, New York, United States. Videos are broadcast at the original time of their recording. For example, a video recorded at 8:05 pm will be broadcast at 8:05 pm. In an effort to minimize resource consumption while using the archive, each video file has been compressed to be smaller than 2 MB.
